# Random Avatars for Blockchain Academy Solidity Course certification

This is the final project for the Blockchain Academy Solidity Course. The project is divided in two repositories.
1. The smart contract for the minting of NFTs using the https://api.multiavatar.com/ avatar library with Chainlink integration for getting a random number using the Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Randomness Function). (This repository)
2. The dApp using React.js, built for interaction with the smart contract in a user-friendly way. (Repository available here)

##Instructions to run this project

To run this project we will use the Hardhat IDE, which needs you to install Node.js and NPM. Finally, we will also need a Chainlink account with Testnet LINK tokens.
